                ASEAN Young Researchers’ Journal is a student-led academic journal
                dedicated to publishing research by students of any age and all backgrounds.
                We firmly believe that reading and conducting research should be open to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through our flagship mentorship programme, <a href="/shro/">SHRO</a>,
                we support secondary and pre-university students in developing original research
                by connecting them with professionals in their fields.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based in Singapore, we are proudly open to the world.

                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>AYRJ was founded by a group of high school students who felt that students also deserved a serious
                    platform for their serious research.</p>
                <p>
                    We met through our school’s science society and were given the chance to pursue research
                    projects across materials science, biology, chemistry, zoology, and beyond.
                    We worked late, learned how to fail usefully, and
                    eventually presented at the national science fair alongside peers tackling virology,
                    artificial intelligence, and quantum physics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And then it ended. Those carefully designed, genuinely novel projects built with real effort
                    had nowhere to live after the showcase. No journal to submit to.
                    No structured pathway to revision, peer feedback, and publication. No clear way for
                    students to learn what “good research” looks like from start to finish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We knew we could do better. That is why AYRJ exists today. We hope that through
                    the culmination of our efforts, we can make AYRJ the premier peer-reviewed journal
                    for students publish their work in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do not measure our success only by “breakthroughs.” If AYRJ helps students contribute
                    careful,
                    honest work to the wider scientific community then we will have succeeded.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Who knows what could come of the research published here? Every serious discovery starts
                    somewhere. We want to be one of those beginnings.
