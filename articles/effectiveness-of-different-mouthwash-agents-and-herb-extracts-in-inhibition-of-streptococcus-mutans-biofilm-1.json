  "abstract": "This study aims to examine the efficacy of different mouthwash agents and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) extracts in the removal of *Streptococcus mutans* ATCC 25175 (*S. mutans*) biofilm and reducing growth of planktonic cells after rinsing. Crystal violet assay, well diffusion assay and MTT assay were utilised to determine the efficacy of the individual mouthwashes and extracts. The data shows that Cetyl Pyridinium Chloride and water extracted *Rhizoma coptidis* (Huang Lian) and *Fructus armeniaca mume* (Wu Mei), had the best holistic performance, with it being the most effective mouthwash in both biofilm removal and in the reduction of planktonic cells. Mouthwash containing ethanol as the active ingredient performed the worst with only a 49.8% decrease in biofilm. Water extracted herbs performance was superior to that of organic solvent extracted herbs. No synergistic effects between the different TCM extracts were found, instead, an antagonistic effect between Huang Lian and Wu Mei was observed. We eventually hope to design and test an alternative natural mouthwash incorporating Huang Lian and/or Wu Mei extracts, identifying the specific active compound found in the respective herbs.",

  "full_text": "# Introduction\nOral health is a key aspect of our lives. Oral diseases\naffect nearly 3.5 billion people[@1], and are a pressing\nissue that must be addressed. With mouth hygiene\nbecoming an ever more major subject, the usage of\nmouthwash has greatly increased. We hypothesise that\na mouthwash containing active compounds found in\nTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) herbs, a TCM\nmouthwash, is more effective in destroying biofilm\nthan non-alcoholic mouthwash. Biofilm formed by\nbacteria such as *Streptococcus mutans* (*S. mutans*) is\nthe main cause of many oral diseases, including\nperiodontal disease and dental decay. *S. mutans* adhere\nto the tooth surface in bacterial communities known as\ndental plaque, secreting acid and various compounds\nthat elicit inflammatory responses and cause tooth\nsurfaces to be demineralised.\n\nThere are various commercially available solutions to\ncombat the rising number of oral health diseases,\nincluding the use of mouthwashes. However, data\nfrom several studies suggest that all types of ethanol,\na prominent ingredient in traditional mouthwashes,\ncontribute to increased oral, pharyngeal and\nlaryngeal cancer risk.[@6] Ethanol mouthwashes also\ncause a burning sensation, making it hard for\nconsumers to gargle for the required time, reducing\nits effectiveness. Therefore, most commercial\nmouthwashes instead contain Sodium lauryl sulfate\n(SLS). However, SLS in toothpastes significantly\nincreased the incidence of desquamation (peeling of\nouter layer of skin) of the oral mucosa.[@7] Commercial\nmouthwashes also commonly include essential oils,\nsuch as peppermint and spearmint oil which do not\nhave inhibitory effects on *S. mutans*.[@8] Additionally,\nthey can cause adverse allergies and other severe\nreactions.[@9] Chlorhexidine, one of the most common\nconventional oral antimicrobial agents, is effective\nagainst a broad spectrum of bacteria, yet is artificial\nand toxic at high concentrations.[@14] In addition, such\nantimicrobial agents may not be effective in\nremoving bacteria due to low concentrations in\nmouthwashes, causing bacteria to develop resistance.\nWith the absence of new antimicrobial agents, there\nare less options available to remove bacteria as they\nbecome resistant to more agents.\n\nAn advantage of using TCM rather than artificial oral\nantimicrobial agents is that some are edible and thus\nhave great potential to be developed as a product for\nday-to-day use. Not only does the use of TCM open\na bank of resources to provide ammunition in the\nfight against bacteria, but the use of natural products\nfound in TCM may also decrease the opportunity for\ndevelopment of drug resistance in microorganisms as\nthey are surrounded by a group of antimicrobial\nchemicals acting together. There have been few\nstudies testing TCM on their effectiveness in\ninhibiting oral biofilms[@15], making our research\nsignificant to future developments of TCM\nmouthwashes. If TCM is effective in inhibiting and\ndestroying oral biofilm, they might be a better\nalternative than chemicals to aid in preventing dental\ndiseases\n\nReviewing past experiments done on antimicrobial\nactivity of TCM against *S. mutans*, a few TCM herbs\nwere shortlisted based on their effectiveness against\nthe formation of *S. mutans* biofilm. *Cortex\nphellodendri* (Huang Bai), *Fructus armeniaca mume*\n(Wu Mei), *Rhizoma coptidis* (Huang Lian), *Fructus\ncrataegi* (Shan Zha), *Galla Chinensis* (Wu Bei\nZi) exhibited antibacterial activities against S.\nmutans with a 8.0mm, 9.0mm, 11.4mm, 5.4mm,\n9.6mm zone of inhibition respectively[@15;@16].\n\n# Materials and Methods\n## Heat Extraction of TCM Compounds\n10% w/v extracts of Huang Bai, Wu Mei, Huang Lian,\nand Shan Zha were prepared by adding 8g of each\nfinely ground herb to 80ml of water and the same\nmethod was repeated using an organic solvent,\nethanol. The mixtures were heated at 65℃ for 24\nhours. Mixtures were then centrifuged and the\nsupernatant decanted into sterile 50ml tubes.\n\n## Biofilm Removal Assay\n0.5ml of 108 CFU/ml S. mutans was added to 6ml LB\nin sterile 60mm Petri dishes and incubated at 37℃ for\n24 hours with gentle shaking to generate the biofilm. After\nbiofilm was formed, LB was poured away and 5ml of\nmouthwash or TCM extract was added to the respective\npetri dishes and incubated for 1 minute. The\nmouthwash or TCM extract solution was then poured\naway. Petri dishes were then dried at 80℃ for 10\nminutes to heat-fix residual biofilm before staining\nwith 1 ml of 0.5% v/v crystal violet solution for 10\nminutes. The stained biofilms were rinsed gently with\nwater to remove excess crystal violet dye. 6ml ethanol\nwas then added to solubilise crystal violet dye retained\nby the biofilm. Concentration of solubilised crystal\nviolet was measured by measuring absorbance at\n590nm and normalised against unrinsed control plates.\n\nPercentage decrease in biofilm was determined by\n$$\\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{Initial~concentration}}{\\mathrm{Concentration~after~rinse}} \\right) \\times 100\\percent$$\nwhere the initial concentration is\ndetermined by crystal violet staining the biofilm\nformed on petri dish after 24 hours of shaking at 37℃.\n\nPercentage decrease in planktonic cells was determined\nby $$\\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{Initial~OD_{600nm}}}{\\mathrm{OD_{600nm}~after~rinsing}} \\right) \\times 100\\percent$$\nwhere the initial OD~600nm~ is determined by measuring the\nabsorbance of LB after 24 hours of shaking at 37℃.\n\n## Biofilm Removal Assay with Recovery Time\n60mm Petri dishes with *S. mutans* biofilm were\nprepared and incubated for 1 minute with\nthe respective mouthwash and TCM extract solutions\nas described above. 6ml LB was then added to\nthe Petri dishes and incubated at 37℃ for 6 hours and 24 hours\nwith gentle shaking to allow for bacterial\nrecovery. Concentration of planktonic cells was\nquantified by measuring optical density of LB in the\nPetri dishes at 600nm. Biofilm formation was\nquantified using the crystal violet assay.\n\n## Well Diffusion Assay\n*S. mutans* was cultured in LB broth and maintained at\n10^8^CFU/ml. 200μl of culture was spread on 100mm\nPetri dishes containing Mueller-Hinton agar. Wells\nwere made by pressing a 9mm diameter sterile cork\nborer into the agar. 50μl of mouthwash or TCM extract\nwere added into respective wells. The plates were\nincubated at 37℃ for 18 hours. Antimicrobial activity for\neach solution was quantified by measuring the zone of\ninhibition (including the wells diameter) which\nappeared after incubation.\n\n## MTT Assay\nMTT[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-\ndiphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay would be carried\nout to assess the metabolic activities of viable biofilm\ncells. The biofilm was formed as described in the [Biofilm Removal Assay]\nand rinsed with mouthwash and plant extracts for 1\nminute. After recovery time incubation, LB\nwas removed and gently rinsed with sterile water and\nreplaced with 2ml of MTT (5mg/ml) for 3 hours in\na dark place. Next, MTT was discarded and 2ml of\nlysing solution (10% (v/v) sodium dodecyl\nsulphate and 50% (v/v) dimethylformamide in\ndistilled water) was added to dissolve the biofilm for\n3 hours at room temperature before reading the OD~590nm~.\nPlates containing no cells were used as blanks.\n\n# Results\n: **Table 1** | Well diffusion test of Mouthwash and TCM extracts.\n\nMouthwash/TCM Sample | Zone of inner diameter\\ /\\ mm\n:--------------------|---------------------------:\nMouthwash 1|20\nMouthwash 2|26\nMouthwash 3|64\nMouthwash 4|24\nWater-extracted *Fructus crataegi* (Shan\\ Zha) |15\nWater-extracted *Fructus armeniaca mume* (Wu\\ Mei) |15\nOrganic-solvent-extracted *Fructus armeniaca mume* (Wu\\ Mei) | 11\nWater-extracted *Cortex phellodendri* (Huang\\ Bai) | 10\nOrganic-solvent-extracted *Cortex phellodendri* (Huang\\ Bai) | 11\nWater-extracted *Galla Chinensis* (Wu\\ Bei\\ Zi) | 15\nWater-extracted *Rhizoma coptidis* (Huang\\ Lian)|20\nOrganic-solvent-extracted *Rhizoma coptidis* (Huang\\ Lian)|21\nChlorhexidine | 23\nControle (Water) | -\n\n![**Figure 1** | Percentage reduction of biofilm after 1 minute exposure to mouthwash.](/static/mouthwash_fig1.png)\n\nMouthwash 2 was the most effective in removing biofilm under 1 minute exposure time to mouthwash.\n\n![**Figure 2** | Percentage reduction of biofilm after 1 minute exposure to water extracted herbs.](/static/mouthwash_fig2.png)\n\nShan Zha was the most effective in removing biofilm\nunder 1 minute exposure to water extracted herbs.\n\n![**Figure 3** | Percentage decrease of biofilm with 6 and 24 hours recovery after 1 minute exposure to mouthwash.](/static/mouthwash_fig3.png)\n\nMouthwash 2 and 4 are the most effective in removing\nbiofilm after 6 and 24 hours respectively.\n\n![**Figure 4** | Percentage decrease of biofilm with 6 and 24 hours recovery after 1 minute exposure to water extracted herbs.](/static/mouthwash_fig4.png)\n\nHuang Lian and Huang Bai were the most effective\nagainst the removal of biofilm with 6 hours and 24\nhours recovery respectively after 1 minute exposure\ntime to water extracted herbs.\n\n\n![**Figure 5** | Percentage decrease of planktonic cells with 6 and 24 hour recovery time after 1 minute exposure time to mouthwash.](/static/mouthwash_fig5.png)\n\nMouthwash 1 was the most effective in removing\nplanktonic cells for 6 hours and 24 hours recovery\ntime.\n\n![**Figure 6** | Percentage decrease of planktonic cells with 6 and 24 hours recovery time after 1 minute exposure time to water extracted herbs.](/static/mouthwash_fig6.png)\n\nHuang Lian was the most effective in the removal\nof planktonic cells for 6 hours and 24 hours\nrecovery time with 1 minute exposure time to water\nextracted herb.\n\n![**Figure 7** | Percentage decrease of metabolically active biofilm with 24 hour recovery time after 5 and 30 seconds exposure time to water extracted herbs.](/static/mouthwash_fig7.png)\n\nMouthwash 3 was the most effective in the removal\nof metabolically active biofilm for both 5 seconds\nand 30 seconds exposure time with 24 hours\nrecovery time.\n\n![**Figure 8** | Percentage decrease of metabolically active biofilm with 24 hour recovery time after 30 seconds exposure time to water extracted herbs.](/static/mouthwash_fig8.png)\n\nHuang Lian was the most effective against the\nremoval of metabolically active biofilm for 24\nhours recovery time with 30 seconds exposure time\nto water extracted herbs.\n\n# Discussion\nIn our experiment, we tested our Mouthwash and\nTCM herb extract samples, with 4 tests, namely, well\ndiffusion assay, Crystal Violet (CV) assay, MTT\nassay, and Concentration of planktonic cells test. For\nour preliminary test, we used the well diffusion assay\nto determine the effectiveness of the sample in\ninhibiting the growth of *S. mutans*. After the\npreliminary tests, we tested the effectiveness of our\nsamples against biofilm removal through the CV\nassay and the MTT assay. However, the CV essay\nwas not as reliable as the CV dye could be absorbed\nby both the dead and live *S. mutans* cells, not\nallowing us to accurately determine the amount of\nbiofilm removed. Thus, MTT assay was used to most\naccurately establish which sample was the most\neffective in removing biofilm. In addition, we utilised\nthe Concentration of Planktonic Cells Test to find out\nthe amount of planktonic cells decreased in each\nsample to supplement our findings.\n\nAfter analysing all our results of experiments that\nwere tested with mouthwashes, according to Table 1,\nour preliminary tests using the well diffusion test\nshowed that Mouthwash 3 had the largest zone of\ninhibition. Based on CV assay in Figures 1 and 3,\nMouthwashes 2, 3, and 4 performed well, they all had\nsimilarly high levels of biofilm removal, as well as a\nlow biofilm recovery after 24 hours. The MTT assay\nin Figure 7, showed that Mouthwash 2 and 3 were the\nmost effective against the removal of metabolically\nactive biofilm. Although chlorhexidine performed\nwell, contrary to our other studies 10, it did not have a\ngreater efficacy than mouthwashes containing Cetyl\nPyridinium Chloride (CPC) or essential oils. All 4\nmouthwash samples were then tested for the reduction\nof planktonic cells in Figure 5, in which Mouthwashes\n1 and 3 had the highest planktonic cell decrease after\n24 hours. In conclusion, Mouthwash 3 had the best\nholistic performance, with it being the most effective\nmouthwash in both biofilm removal and in the\nreduction of planktonic cells. Thus, based on Table 2 \nCPC is the most effective active\ningredient.\n\nBased on our literature review[@4], we hypothesised that\nethanol based mouthwashes would be more effective\nin killing planktonic cells and removing biofilm.\nHowever based on Figure 1, Mouthwash 1 performed\nthe worst, with a 49.8% decrease in biofilm. This\ncould be due to the reduced ethanol content in\ncommercially available mouthwashes since high\nconcentrations of ethanol have harmful effects. Other\nreports also supported that the ethanol concentrations\nin mouthwashes are too low to have a significant\neffect on the destruction of biofilm.[@5]\n\nAccording to the article [@15], heat water extraction was\nused to extract active compounds found in the TCM\nherbs. Additionally, since organic solvent extraction\nhad not been performed in other researches, organic\nsolvent extraction was carried out to identify other\nactive compounds that are insoluble in water and\nsoluble in the organic solvent, which would contribute\nto a different result for water and organic solvent\nextracted herbs.\n\nIn general, water extracted herbs performed relatively\nbetter in all the tests than that for organic solvent\nextracted herbs. After analysing our results of\nexperiments that were conducted on water extracted\nherbs, according to Table 1, our preliminary tests\nusing the well diffusion test showed that Huang Lian\nhad the largest zone of inhibition out of all the water\nextracted TCM herbs, indicating that it is the most\neffective in inhibiting the growth of S. mutans.\nTesting the water extracted TCM herbs’ effectiveness\nof removing biofilm, according to the CV assay in\nFigure 2 and 4, water extracted Shan Zha and Huang\nLian were the only herbs that showed a decrease in\nbiofilm, while the other herbs encouraged the growth\nof biofilm. Shan Zha, Huang Lian, Huang Bai, and\nWu Mei, had a decrease in biofilm recovery after 24\nhours. However, Wu Bei Zi caused an increase in the\nbiofilm after recovery after 24 hours, concluding that\nWu Bei Zi is rather not effective. To further\ndifferentiate the effectiveness of the remaining water\nextracted TCM herbs, we tested them using MTT\nassay in Figure 8, which showed that Huang Lian and\nWu Mei were the most effective against biofilm\nremoval. Additionally, the concentration of planktonic\ncells test in Figure 6 showed that Huang Lian and Wu\nMei had the highest planktonic cell decrease after 24\nhours. Since Huang Lian and Wu Mei performed\nrelatively well in all the tests, they are the most\neffective herbs in terms of both biofilm removal and\nreduction of planktonic cells.\n\nBased on the graphs above, among the water-based\nextracts of TCM herbs, Huang Lian and Wu Mei\nperformed the best. Thus, they were tested for\nsynergistic effect using the MTT assay. Figure 9, 75%\nHuang Lian and 25% Wu Mei at 60s exposure\nwas the most effective. However, when combined\ntogether at different concentrations, there was an\noverall increase in metabolically active biofilm, which\nshows the antagonistic relationship between Huang\nLian and Wu Mei, as they performed better without\nthe presence of each other.\n\nThe efficacy of the TCM herbs against biofilm\nremoval is proportional to the concentration of the\nTCM herbs. Out of the diluted herb extracts, Huang\nLian and Wu Mei at 75% concentrations are both the\nmost effective on their own. The efficacy of the TCM\nherbs against biofilm removal is also directly\nproportional to the duration of exposure. Thus, when\ntested with 60s of exposure time, the herbs\ncaused a higher percentage decrease of metabolically\nactive biofilm than that for 30s of exposure\ntime. Therefore, to achieve maximum efficacy of the\nTCM herb, the TCM mouthwash should have the\nhighest concentration of the TCM herb possible and\nusers should rinse their mouths with the TCM\nmouthwash for a longer duration.\n\nThe limitations of this experiment was the inability to\nidentify and isolate the specific active compound in\nthe TCM herb, due to the lack of equipment. The\nability to identify the specific active compound will\nallow us to customise specific extraction methods to\nisolate and extract the most amount of the\ncompounds. In addition, the heat extraction method\nhas a limit to the concentration of herbs that can be\nextracted. The herbs would have a greater efficacy if\nanother extraction method which has a higher\nconcentration limit was used. Studies have shown that\na TCM herb extract with a higher concentration would\nhave been more effective in killing the bacteria. The\ncurrent concentration of 100mg/ml in this experiment\nmay have been too low and could be increased. Based\non another study, a concentration that was 2250%\nhigher than that in our study was used 15. Hence, an\nextract with a higher concentration is likely to be\nmore effective in killing the bacteria. Lastly, *S. mutans*\nmay not be sufficient representative of oral\nbiofilm due to the great diversity of the oral microbe\ncommunity and the variation of oral bacteria among\ndifferent persons.\n\n# Conclusion\nMouthwash 3, with Cetyl Pyridinium Chloride as its\nactive ingredient, had the best overall performance in\nterms of biofilm removal and reduction of planktonic\ncells. Water extracted Huang Lian and Wu Mei were\nthe most effective herbs in inhibiting the growth of *S. mutans*\nbiofilm and planktonic cells. However, when\nHuang Lian and Wu Mei were used together, there was\nan antagonistic relationship. Overall, the active\ningredient in non-alcoholic mouthwashes is more\neffective in inhibiting the growth of *S. mutans* biofilm\nas compared to the active compounds found in TCM\nherbs.\n\nFuture work includes investigating the active\ningredient in the herb extracts of Huang Lian such that\nthe active ingredient can be extracted. A prototype of a\nmouthwash using Huang Lian and Wu Mei’s active\ningredient and Cetyl Pyridinium Chloride (CPC) can\nbe created. Further investigations on the synergistic\neffect between the specific active ingredients of herb\nextracts and mouthwashes.\n\n# Acknowledgements and Declarations\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interests."
