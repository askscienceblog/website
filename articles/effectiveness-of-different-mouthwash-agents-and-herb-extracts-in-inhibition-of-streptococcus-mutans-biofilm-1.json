  "abstract": "This study aims to examine the efficacy of different mouthwash agents and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) extracts in the removal of *Streptococcus mutans* ATCC 25175 (*S. mutans*) biofilm and reducing growth of planktonic cells after rinsing. Crystal violet assay, well diffusion assay and MTT assay were utilised to determine the efficacy of the individual mouthwashes and extracts. The data shows that Cetyl Pyridinium Chloride and water extracted *Rhizoma coptidis* (Huang Lian) and *Fructus armeniaca mume* (Wu Mei), had the best holistic performance, with it being the most effective mouthwash in both biofilm removal and in the reduction of planktonic cells. Mouthwash containing ethanol as the active ingredient performed the worst with only a 49.8% decrease in biofilm. Water extracted herbs performance was superior to that of organic solvent extracted herbs. No synergistic effects between the different TCM extracts were found, instead, an antagonistic effect between Huang Lian and Wu Mei was observed. We eventually hope to design and test an alternative natural mouthwash incorporating Huang Lian and/or Wu Mei extracts, identifying the specific active compound found in the respective herbs.",

  "full_text": "# Introduction\nOral health is a key aspect of our lives. Oral diseases\naffect nearly 3.5 billion people[@1], and are a pressing\nissue that must be addressed. With mouth hygiene\nbecoming an ever more major subject, the usage of\nmouthwash has greatly increased. We hypothesise that\na mouthwash containing active compounds found in\nTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) herbs, a TCM\nmouthwash, is more effective in destroying biofilm\nthan non-alcoholic mouthwash. Biofilm formed by\nbacteria such as *Streptococcus mutans* (*S. mutans*) is\nthe main cause of many oral diseases, including\nperiodontal disease and dental decay. *S. mutans* adhere\nto the tooth surface in bacterial communities known as\ndental plaque, secreting acid and various compounds\nthat elicit inflammatory responses and cause tooth\nsurfaces to be demineralised.\n\nThere are various commercially available solutions to\ncombat the rising number of oral health diseases,\nincluding the use of mouthwashes. However, data\nfrom several studies suggest that all types of ethanol,\na prominent ingredient in traditional mouthwashes,\ncontribute to increased oral, pharyngeal and\nlaryngeal cancer risk.[@6] Ethanol mouthwashes also\ncause a burning sensation, making it hard for\nconsumers to gargle for the required time, reducing\nits effectiveness. Therefore, most commercial\nmouthwashes instead contain Sodium lauryl sulfate\n(SLS). However, SLS in toothpastes significantly\nincreased the incidence of desquamation (peeling of\nouter layer of skin) of the oral mucosa.[@7] Commercial\nmouthwashes also commonly include essential oils,\nsuch as peppermint and spearmint oil which do not\nhave inhibitory effects on *S. mutans*.[@8] Additionally,\nthey can cause adverse allergies and other severe\nreactions.[@9] Chlorhexidine, one of the most common\nconventional oral antimicrobial agents, is effective\nagainst a broad spectrum of bacteria, yet is artificial\nand toxic at high concentrations.[@14] In addition, such\nantimicrobial agents may not be effective in\nremoving bacteria due to low concentrations in\nmouthwashes, causing bacteria to develop resistance.\nWith the absence of new antimicrobial agents, there\nare less options available to remove bacteria as they\nbecome resistant to more agents.\n\nAn advantage of using TCM rather than artificial oral\nantimicrobial agents is that some are edible and thus\nhave great potential to be developed as a product for\nday-to-day use. Not only does the use of TCM open\na bank of resources to provide ammunition in the\nfight against bacteria, but the use of natural products\nfound in TCM may also decrease the opportunity for\ndevelopment of drug resistance in microorganisms as\nthey are surrounded by a group of antimicrobial\nchemicals acting together. There have been few\nstudies testing TCM on their effectiveness in\ninhibiting oral biofilms[@15], making our research\nsignificant to future developments of TCM\nmouthwashes. If TCM is effective in inhibiting and\ndestroying oral biofilm, they might be a better\nalternative than chemicals to aid in preventing dental\ndiseases\n\nReviewing past experiments done on antimicrobial\nactivity of TCM against *S. mutans*, a few TCM herbs\nwere shortlisted based on their effectiveness against\nthe formation of *S. mutans* biofilm. *Cortex\nphellodendri* (Huang Bai), *Fructus armeniaca mume*\n(Wu Mei), *Rhizoma coptidis* (Huang Lian), *Fructus\ncrataegi* (Shan Zha), *Galla Chinensis* (Wu Bei\nZi) exhibited antibacterial activities against S.\nmutans with a 8.0mm, 9.0mm, 11.4mm, 5.4mm,\n9.6mm zone of inhibition respectively[@15;@16].\n\n# Materials and Methods\n## Heat Extraction of TCM Compounds\n10% w/v extracts of Huang Bai, Wu Mei, Huang Lian,\nand Shan Zha were prepared by adding 8g of each\nfinely ground herb to 80ml of water and the same\nmethod was repeated using an organic solvent,\nethanol. The mixtures were heated at 65℃ for 24\nhours. Mixtures were then centrifuged and the\nsupernatant decanted into sterile 50ml tubes.\n\n## Biofilm Removal Assay\n0.5ml of 108 CFU/ml S. mutans was added to 6ml LB\nin sterile 60mm Petri dishes and incubated at 37℃ for\n24 hours with gentle shaking to generate the biofilm. After\nbiofilm was formed, LB was poured away and 5ml of\nmouthwash or TCM extract was added to the respective\npetri dishes and incubated for 1 minute. The\nmouthwash or TCM extract solution was then poured\naway. Petri dishes were then dried at 80℃ for 10\nminutes to heat-fix residual biofilm before staining\nwith 1 ml of 0.5% v/v crystal violet solution for 10\nminutes. The stained biofilms were rinsed gently with\nwater to remove excess crystal violet dye. 6ml ethanol\nwas then added to solubilise crystal violet dye retained\nby the biofilm. Concentration of solubilised crystal\nviolet was measured by measuring absorbance at\n590nm and normalised against unrinsed control plates.\n\nPercentage decrease in biofilm was determined by\n$$\\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{Initial~concentration}}{\\mathrm{Concentration~after~rinse}} \\right) \\times 100\\percent$$\nwhere the initial concentration is\ndetermined by crystal violet staining the biofilm\nformed on petri dish after 24 hours of shaking at 37℃.\n\nPercentage decrease in planktonic cells was determined\nby $$\\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{Initial~OD_{600nm}}}{\\mathrm{OD_{600nm}~after~rinsing}} \\right) \\times 100\\percent$$\nwhere the initial OD~600nm~ is determined by measuring the\nabsorbance of LB after 24 hours of shaking at 37℃.\n\n## Biofilm Removal Assay with Recovery Time\n60mm Petri dishes with *S. mutans* biofilm were\nprepared and incubated for 1 minute with\nthe respective mouthwash and TCM extract solutions\nas described above. 6ml LB was then added to\nthe Petri dishes and incubated at 37℃ for 6 hours and 24 hours\nwith gentle shaking to allow for bacterial\nrecovery. Concentration of planktonic cells was\nquantified by measuring optical density of LB in the\nPetri dishes at 600nm. Biofilm formation was\nquantified using the crystal violet assay.\n\n## Well Diffusion Assay\n*S. mutans* was cultured in LB broth and maintained at\n10^8^CFU/ml. 200μl of culture was spread on 100mm\nPetri dishes containing Mueller-Hinton agar. Wells\nwere made by pressing a 9mm diameter sterile cork\nborer into the agar. 50μl of mouthwash or TCM extract\nwere added into respective wells. The plates were\nincubated at 37℃ for 18 hours. Antimicrobial activity for\neach solution was quantified by measuring the zone of\ninhibition (including the wells diameter) which\nappeared after incubation.\n\n## MTT Assay\nMTT[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-\ndiphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay would be carried\nout to assess the metabolic activities of viable biofilm\ncells. The biofilm was formed as described in the [Biofilm Removal Assay]\nand rinsed with mouthwash and plant extracts for 1\nminute. After recovery time incubation, LB\nwas removed and gently rinsed with sterile water and\nreplaced with 2ml of MTT (5mg/ml) for 3 hours in\na dark place. Next, MTT was discarded and 2ml of\nlysing solution (10% (v/v) sodium dodecyl\nsulphate and 50% (v/v) dimethylformamide in\ndistilled water) was added to dissolve the biofilm for\n3 hours at room temperature before reading the OD~590nm~.\nPlates containing no cells were used as blanks.\n\n# Results\nMouthwash/TCM Sample | Zone of inner diameter / mm\n:-------------------:|:--------------------------:\n1|20\n2|26\n3|64\n4|24\nWater extracted "
